        Nowadays, more and more businesses migrate online. The pandemic time
        made a considerable punch to force offline shops to work on their online
        presence. It's really reasonable to redirect investment flow from the
        arrangement of the offline store to the online presence. After all, the
        investment will be compensated soon because covering an incomparably
        larger audience, the online store support requires fewer expenses than
        offline infrastructure does.

        content, product, and categories); stock and inventory management;
        payments; shipping; bundles; discounts; promotions; clients management;
        multistore; multicurrency; multilanguage support etc... etc... etc...
