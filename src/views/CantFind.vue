      Can’t Find A Suitable Vendor For Your Project?

        You want to develop something dynamic or unique and it’s extremely
        difficult to find developers who are capable of helping you to realize
        your project?
      </li>
      <li>
        You have a conceptual idea, but need someone who is capable of
        developing the idea into something comprehensible which could be
        developed into a tangible project?
      </li>
      <li>
        You are looking to develop something based on recent technology and
        there are not enough qualified devs in your region to manage it?
      </li>
      <li>
        Some clients have existing online presence since the early 2000s
        <ul>
          <li>
            and their technology is outdated so it’s difficult to find
            developers who are willing to work on their coding,
          </li>
          <li>
            not to mention that it’s impossible to update their server
            environments, because the existing code can’t run on new CGI and
            scripting languages.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        You’ve tired of looking for a decent agency, because they all promised
        good results initially but all eventually failed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The list could go on and on, but the key factor here is that if you have
      not yet successfully found the best developers for turning your ideas and
      dreams into a tangibly marketable reality; as well as continually
      supporting your product, then please consider the following points
      regarding our services:

      It would be dishonest to say that we are capable of covering everything,
      but there are a number of points which go to show that we are capable of
      handling situations which usually cause other developers to hang their
      heads in dismay and retire from the project.

        It’s impossible to stay static - the only options are to either move
        forward or remain treading water in a stationary position and finally
        deteriorate before you disappear. We are always striving to move forward
        and eager to help new companies find their direction:
        <p>
          So; for example, in the case of a client looking for unique resources,
          or wanting to be a part of some new IT trend from its inception - we
          are always happy to comply and walk the entire distance with them,
          helping, as well as adapting each step of the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please see a few examples below of projects we have been involved with
          in the past:

            We started developing for Android only a few months after their
            first Android phone had been released in 2008.
          </li>
          <li>
            We set up an exclusive Magento team for a previous partnership to
            support many of their new Magento extensions, and since then we have
            exponentially continued growing in this direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            We set up a fully trained and functional team of 6 data capturing
            personnel within a month after a client had requested it.
          </li>
          <li>
            We started developing for Apple TV as soon as Apple announced TVML
          </li>

      We had clients who wanted to experiment with a new concept and we helped

        deals freely. They had a limited budget to implement the idea, so we
        discussed what could be done within the agreed upon 200 hours. We
        developed the MVP and we knew that the idea was working when the trial
        users loved the idea. We continued its development and brought ideas to
        the table on how to improve the MVP and turn it into a long-term project
        with a team of 7 devs involved.

        requests so that the sites which received a redirected user, considered
        the user to have originated from the site specified in the HREF source
        link. We offered a few ways to execute their ideas and after we helped
        them prove that the idea could work, the client began building a
        collaborative system with us which would be able to direct traffic to
        any source.

        A trusted partner wanted to jump into the gaming development industry
        and asked us to propose a quick way to do it. Within a short period of
        time we had discovered a number of frameworks for game development and
        settled on Lua/Corona. As a result; within a month we had our first
        completed game developed and within a year we had developed a number of

      Some clients only have vague ideas and they need the help of development
      services to further develop their concepts. Sometimes the ideas are
      however so unusual that we don’t have any idea where to start - but we
      usually always find a way.

        Another client wanted us to develop a bot which would automatically aid
        gamers by ‘watching’ the advertisements and collecting points for them
        while the player was AFK. It was a huge challenge, but we finally found
        a way and developed a cool bot which checked all the boxes.
      </li>
      <li>
        We worked with
       <a href="https://laspi.com/" target="_blank"><i>laspi.com</i></a>
        on their
        <a href="/cant-find/project/laspi">intranet</a>. The client trusted us
        and wanted us to further enhance their system - he wanted the system to
        predict the behavior of his site’s visitors. After the statistical data
        research, we came up with a few ideas, investigated them and finally
        developed an algorithm which allowed the client to view the sought-after
        predictions after the users had managed their way around his site.
      </li>
      <li>
        We have another client:
        <a href="https://fundraiserssports.com" target="_blank"
          ><i>https://fundraiserssports.com</i></a>, who makes engraved bricks for sports fans and then creates mosaics
        from them. They wanted us to create a virtual wall which would imitate
        the real wall with the original bricks, where fans would be able to find
        their brick while on their mobile phone… but we had nothing to start
        with - they didn’t even have a photo of the wall to show us. And how to
        deal with newly inserted bricks? To re-image the entire wall for each
        new brick wouldn’t be an option. Eventually the solution was simpler and
        more modern than we had anticipated: we prepared a drone that took a
        series of photos of the wall with GEO coordinates - after that, we were
        able to build an MVP on Unity to allow the client the opportunity to
        achieve the results he had wanted from the start.
